## Darkio
Darkio is a theme based on the dark themes. It uses blue as a main tint. But it uses a variety of colours. The colours aren't supposed to be that much, it's based on a minimal yet readable design. Since the creation isn't fully completed yet, feel free to leave any feedback or errors in the github repository.

### Information
* Theme created by Cas Martens.

**Enjoy!**
